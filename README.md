# About Polyglot

Polyglot is an ExpressionEngine add-on that enables developers to create sites for multiple languages and locales. It helps you manage the translation of your templates, localize date, time, number and currency formats.

## What Polyglot Does

Polyglot allows you to:

* Set up a language variable on a single instance of ExpressionEngine
* Attriubte that language value dynamically using a rule, such as first segment (e.g. `site.com/espanol `) or sub-domain (e.g. `en.site.com`)
* Move text out of the templates and into language files (glossaries)
* Load text appropriate for a given language
* Present dates and numbers in the appropriate format for a given language
* Keep these settings and translations stored in files for easier version-controlling, using a system like Git or SVN, and easier sharing
